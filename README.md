Exploratory Data Analysis of Zomato dataset using Python. Covers restaurant types, ratings, votes, spending patterns, and online vs offline ordering trends. Insights help identify customer preferences, popular cuisines, and opportunities for offers to boost offline engagement.

This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Zomato dataset, which provides information about restaurants, customer votes, ratings, and modes of ordering in India. The purpose of this project is to understand customer preferences, ordering patterns, and restaurant performance, and to provide insights that can help Zomato and restaurant owners make better business decisions.

As online food delivery continues to grow, understanding how customers interact with different restaurant types and modes (online vs offline) has become increasingly important. This project aims to explore the factors that influence customer choices, their spending behavior, and the types of restaurants that dominate both online and offline orders.

Through this analysis, we hope to provide valuable insights for Zomato, restaurant owners, and food industry stakeholders. The results can be used to improve marketing strategies, design offers for offline customers, and enhance the dining and delivery experience for food lovers.

# Project Workflow

* Importing libraries (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn)
* Loading the dataset into a Jupyter Notebook

#  Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

* Handling missing values
* Renaming columns for readability
* Dropping duplicates
* Converting datatypes where necessary

# Exploratory Data Analysis & Visualization

* What type of restaurant do the majority of customers order from?
* How many votes has each type of restaurant received from customers?
* What are the ratings that the majority of restaurants have received?
* What is their average spending per order?
* Which order mode (online or offline) has received the maximum rating?
* Which type of restaurant received more offline orders, so that Zomato can provide offers to those customers?

# CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION 
Customers generally prefer dining out at restaurants, especially in the 'Dining' category, which is the most popular and receives the highest number of user votes. While ratings across all restaurant types are generally positive (3.5–4.0), online orders tend to receive slightly higher ratings than offline orders. Furthermore, cafés are preferred for online orders, whereas dining restaurants see more offline visits, highlighting a clear distinction in customer behavior between ordering online and eating out. Based on these insights, it may be beneficial for Zomato to consider targeted promotions for dining restaurants, as they appear to be the venues that most customers prefer visiting in person.
